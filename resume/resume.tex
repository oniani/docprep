% 'moderncv' loads the package 'hyperref' by itself with its own 'hypersetup'.
% This is done from 'moderncv.cls'. Hence, no need to load hyperref again.
% Instead, load the 'hypersetup' using \AfterPreamble (or \AtBeginDocument)
% hook as shown in the code below.
\AfterPreamble{%
  \hypersetup{% PDF information and nice-looking urls
    pdfauthor  = {David Oniani},
    pdftitle   = {David Oniani's Resume},
